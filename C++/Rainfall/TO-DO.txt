Fix monster spawning
- Invisible "Monster Spawners" that only spawn one at a time in a specific spot
- Monster can't move more than X tiles away from spawn location (maybe 10-20 tiles)
- When a monster is killed, notify the spawner so it can spawn another after a short delay
- Monsters only automatically attack if your combat level is lower than theirs or if you attack them first

Static map instead of randomly generated
- (DONE) Each area about the size of a screen without having to scroll
- (DONE) Bumping into an edge moves you to the map in that direction if it exists.
- (DONE) Save map to files?
- (DONE) Load map from files if it already exists
- (DONE) Easy in-game map editor
- -  (DONE) If a map doesn't exist in a spot and the player is an admin/in edit mode, offer to make a map there.
- -  (DONE) Place or change tiles and edit their info in-game, save for future loads
- - Create an internal library of tiles to choose from. Save current tile to list with a button


UI Stuff
- Minimap showing adjacent maps, hover over spots on the map to display a name
- - Minimap mouse-look: Map name, contains monsters
- - Only refresh the minimap readout when the player changes overworld tile. Save the data to an easy to reference array in the meantime
- (DONE) Skills menu (Show skill names, level, current experience, and experience needed to level up)
- Equipped item menu
- Magic menu (Show all spells names, cost to cast in runes, level requirement)
- (DONE) Switch between inventory/skills/equipped items/magic menus at will
- (DONE) Mouse move


Magic
- Spells have a level requirement, an experience amount that they grant, and required runes to cast
- Runes
- - Core Elemental: Water, Plant,    Fire,    Earth,   Air
- - Super Elemental: Ice,   Wood,  Lightning, Metal,  Sound?
- - Alignment: Chaotic, Lawful, Good, Evil
- - Catalytic Runes: Space, Force, Internal, External



Multiplayer Syncing
- (DONE) Only show players on the same map tile
- (DONE) Allow players to move between map tiles
- Sync item picking up and dropping. Players don't need to know what's in other players inventories
- Sync monster positions across all clients on the same map tile.
- Sync tile/monsters being depleted and respawned properly
- (DONE) Sync and show all players immediately instead of waiting for them to move
- Movement Code + Map Sync
- - Server only needs to be aware of the name, blocksMove, and location of tiles
- - Player sends a move message -> Server evaluates if they can move -> Sends back a message if they can -> player position updates based on message
- - Create a tile library that is used to place tiles
- - Tile library definitions exist on server and get sent to clients when they connect
- - Map files are stored on the server and only store the ID of each tile
- - Send maps to players when they need them
- - Only keep maps that have players on them actively in memory
- - When the last player leaves a map, save it to file and drop it from memory
- - When a player enters a map that's unloaded, load it and store it
