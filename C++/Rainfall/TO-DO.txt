Fix monster spawning
- Invisible "Monster Spawners" that only spawn one at a time in a specific spot
- Monster can't move more than X tiles away from spawn location (maybe 10-20 tiles)
- When a monster is killed, notify the spawner so it can spawn another after a short delay
- Monsters only automatically attack if your combat level is lower than theirs or if you attack them first

Static map instead of randomly generated
- (DONE) Each area about the size of a screen without having to scroll
- (DONE) Bumping into an edge moves you to the map in that direction if it exists.
- (DONE) Save map to files?
- (DONE) Load map from files if it already exists
- (DONE) Easy in-game map editor
- -  (DONE) If a map doesn't exist in a spot and the player is an admin/in edit mode, offer to make a map there.
- -  (DONE) Place or change tiles and edit their info in-game, save for future loads
- - Create an internal library of tiles to choose from. Save current tile to list with a button


UI Stuff
- Minimap showing adjacent maps, hover over spots on the map to display a name
- - Minimap mouse-look: Map name, contains monsters
- - Only refresh the minimap readout when the player changes overworld tile. Save the data to an easy to reference array in the meantime
- (DONE) Skills menu (Show skill names, level, current experience, and experience needed to level up)
- Equipped item menu
- Magic menu (Show all spells names, cost to cast in runes, level requirement)
- (DONE) Switch between inventory/skills/equipped items/magic menus at will
- (DONE) Mouse move



The Item Rework
- (DONE) Item Definitions
- - (DONE) Everything needs a name and ID. Maybe if it's stackable? Item category, equippable slot
- - (DONE) Item Categories: Hatchet, Pickaxe, Potion, Food, Rune, Fishing, Hammer, Knife
- - (DONE) Equippable slots: Hand, Off-hand, Head, Torso, Legs, Hands, Feet, Ring1, Ring2, Amulet, Cape
- - - Cape could be a cosmetic-type slot instead of an actual equipment slot, set the color of the player avatar
- (DONE) Build a server-side database of item definitions loaded from file
- (DONE) Send item definitions to player on connect
- (DONE) Player inventory stored in sPlayerDescription to be passed around for quick logic
- (DONE) Player inventory is just an array of 28 pairs (int item id and int quantity)
- (DONE) Server keeps track of what items are on each map and where they are on the map.
- - (DONE) Send all items on a map to a player when they move there
- When a player drops an item, update their inventory on the server and make the item appear for other players
- When a player picks up an item, update their inventory on the server and make the item disappear for other players
- Minimap numbers seem to be getting garbled on the way to the player



NPC Dialogue
- Differentiate between NPCs and monsters - maybe all NPCs use the same symbol
- NPCs probably don't need to move around much
- Bump into NPCs to talk to them
- - Open a dialogue menu
- - Generic dialogue, quest dialogue, shop dialogue



Magic
- Spells have a level requirement, an experience amount that they grant, and required runes to cast
- Runes
- - Core Elemental: Water, Plant,    Fire,    Earth,   Air
- - Super Elemental: Ice,   Wood,  Lightning, Metal,  Sound?
- - Alignment: Chaotic, Lawful, Good, Evil
- - Catalytic Runes: Space, Force, Internal, External



Multiplayer Syncing
- (DONE) Only show players on the same map tile
- (DONE) Allow players to move between map tiles
- Sync item picking up and dropping. Players don't need to know what's in other players inventories
- Sync monster positions across all clients on the same map tile.
- Sync tile/monsters being depleted and respawned properly
- (DONE) Sync and show all players immediately instead of waiting for them to move
- (DONE) Movement Code + Map Sync
- - (DONE) Server only needs to be aware of the name, blocksMove, and location of tiles
- - (DONE) Player sends a move message -> Server evaluates if they can move -> Sends back a message if they can -> player position updates based on message
- - (DONE) Create a tile library that is used to place tiles
- - (SHELVED) Tile library definitions exist on server and get sent to clients when they connect
- - (DONE) Map files are stored on the server and only store the ID of each tile
- - (DONE) Send maps to players when they need them
- - (UNNECESSARY) Only keep maps that have players on them actively in memory
- - (UNNECESSARY) When the last player leaves a map, save it to file and drop it from memory
- - (UNNECESSARY) When a player enters a map that's unloaded, load it and store it
- - (DONE) When a player changes overworld location, send them the updated minimap too
- - (DONE) Make it so players don't store maps locally at all - it's pointless if they get the data every time they move maps anyways.
- - (DONE) Only send the map to the required player after they don't store locally anymore
