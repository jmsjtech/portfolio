NPCs Schedule system
- Assign each NPC a schedule. Each point should have a position (and map, if they move maps) and the time they leave that place to move to the next one.
- NPCs should be teleported back to their homes when a day-skip occurs

Dialogue system for interacting with NPCs
- Store how much they like you
- Change shop prices based on relationship
- Allow gifting items
-- Lists of liked and disliked items, liked increases friendship while disliked decreases it.
- Different dialogue based on relationship, season, time of day, etc
- Each time dialogue is opened pick 3 random topics that can be selected to talk about.
-- Each NPC likes and dislikes different topics
-- Talking about liked topics increases their opinion of you, disliked topics do the opposite. Loved and hated topics double the changes
-- Diminishing returns in the same day - maybe a max of +/- 10 points, minimum points are -100 and maximum are +100


The Farm
- Has a small shack.
-- Bed to pass the day (move to tomorrow at 6am)
-- Holes in walls that need to be fixed, to teach construction mechanics
-- Basement with a rat problem to teach some combat basics
- Plot of tillable land
- Well to refill watering can
- Allow players to build in this map? Maybe build everywhere except in town?


Forest Outside Town - maybe make it static?
- Stop normal items from spawning there
- Spawn mushrooms, herbs, and flowers


The Old Mines
- First X levels of mines before leading into other biomes at the bottom?
- Spawns ore rocks as enemies (that can't fight back), destroying them drops the ore.
-- Higher chance to get ore if you use a proper tool
- Common enemies: Kobolds, Goblins, 


Alchemy systems
- Assign RYBW values to each elixir
- Assign RYBW values to ingredients
- Combine any amount of ingredients into vial, heat to turn into a potions
-- If the prospective potion RYBW matches a valid potion RYBW, you get that potions
- Process ingredients to get special essences that only have a single RYBW value for easier future Use



Item Use System: Separate zap/aim wands into their own menu



Elites, Uniques, Wondrous Items, and Artifacts
-Elites: Enhanced versions of monsters using generic templates that apply to any monster
- Uniques: Named monsters that can only be killed once (they won't spawn if the player has already killed them)
-- Uniques (maybe only some?) spawn in a prefab section customized to them
- Wondrous Items: Enhanced items using templates fit to either specific item types or all items
- Artifacts: Named items that can only spawn once (won't spawn if the player has already found them)






Implement more equipment slots: Amulet, Ring1, Ring2
