Portfolio of coding projects I've made. Most aren't finished to my full vision (because my full vision is usually way too ambitious), but still probably functional in some capacity.


C# Projects:
- NeonBot: A C# conversion of oasis-bot (see below), converting some of the commands and adding new commands. Functional but incomplete.
- StardewMods: A collection of the mods I've made for Stardew Valley.
- TearsInRain: A roguelike intended to put a couple very uncommon twists on the genre (multiplayer and casual farming elements). Multiplayer has been implemented from the start and works using the Discord GameSDK.


Java Projects:
- Monty Hall Proof: A simple proof of the Monty Hall problem, showing that you have a 66% chance of choosing the correct door if you always choose to switch when given the option. (Rather than the common mistaken assumption people may make, which is that it's 50/50 when given the option to switch.)


Javascript Projects:
- oasis-bot: A chat bot that runs in Discord. Created to provide many many useful features for use in the tabletop roleplaying system GURPS.
